ARE YOU TIRED:
- Of transfering new maps for OSU from "Downloads" to "Songs" directory everytime host changes the map?
- ...
- ... actually thats all I desire this programm to do.

I am glad to introduce you a solution to all of your problems (with loads of help from @egorozh, ty very much). <br>
No longer you have to suffer manually transfering lots of same-type files from your "Download" folder to desired destination! <br>

It works with all types of files! <br>
Transfers them where-ever YOU want! <br>
AND GUESS WHAT? 
YOU don't have to do shit.
