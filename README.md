ARE YOU TIRED:
- Of transfering new maps for OSU from "Downloads" to "Songs" directory everytime host changes the map?
- ...
- ... actually thats all I desire this programm to do.

I am glad to introduce you a solution to all of your problems (with loads of help from @egorozh, ty very much). <br>
No longer you have to suffer manually transfering lots of same-type files from your "Download" folder to desired destination! <br>

It works with all types of files! <br>
Transfers them where-ever YOU want! <br>
AND GUESS WHAT? 
YOU don't have to do shit.

Setup: <br>

0. Launch (DirectoryTransfer.UI.exe) and right-click LUL-icon (it's really not a virus) in system tray
1. Click "Open Settings"
2. Choose directory where fileas at
3. Specify type of files that needs to be transfered
4. Choose directory where files needs to be moved 
5. DONE
